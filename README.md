## ü©∫ About Me

With a foundation in **medical device engineering** and FDA-regulated product development, I specialize in cardiovascular devices, chemical sensors, electro-optics, and hemodynamics. Lately, I‚Äôve been expanding my toolkit to include rapid prototyping (machining, welding, fabrication), firmware, and software/web development.

Whether building life-saving tech, designing new products, or automating my own systems, I thrive at the intersection of engineering and creativity.

> "Solving problems is the act of learning and applying something new. I love solving problems to bring about tangible benefits. I'm good at it too."
